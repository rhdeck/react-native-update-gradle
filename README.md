# react-native-update-gradle

React-native plugin to update gradle version. Checks your project-level gradle files to update as necessary. Fires on link.

# Usage

```
yarn add react-native-update-gradle
react-native link
```

# Notes

I created this to enable better support for Kotlin-based RN modules, which require a gradle version a touch newer than the RN hello world template.
